        <div class="info4us building">
            <p>Zakaria Ghanamy Abdul-Nayaw is my name, with 15years working experience with N.V.T.I as a S.T.O 
                in building and construction department and also the HOD of the construction department

                <p>Student who wise to offer the course of construction are required to have the following tools </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trowel</li>
                        <li>Spirit level</li>
                        <li>Woodin float</li>
                        <li>Mason square</li>
                        <li>Measuring tap</li>
                        <li>Straight Edge</li>
                        <li>Masion Hammer</li>
                        <li>Club Hammer</li>
                        <li>Chisel Point and flat</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some of which would be made availble to students by their department.
                </p>

                <p class="peace">students are to note! that with the field of construction, teachering bases are fourty percent(40%) Theory and sixty percent(60%) practicals where 
                    students spend most of the time on open field. The department has many students some of which 
                    some are in the Militery, Police, Prison Service and some in the construction industry 
                    about forty percent(40%) of students are able to further their education up to 1st degree and some make it 
                    to Masters.
                </p>

                <p class="peace">The department works with instructor of Higher qualification such as First degree and H.N.D 
                    to be able to offer students of the construction department the best form of knowledge to better prepare 
                    the for the outside world. Previously they use to go on attachment but due to time limitations its duraction has 
                    been cut short but few do during holidays. Students are involved in all construction
                    works excuted by the department. It helps them boost their experience level.
                </p>

                <p class="peace">Construction students are allowed to take interest in other especially in plumbing since the knowledge in the 
                    field of plumbing helps them to make better decisions in carry out their field work as Constructors.
