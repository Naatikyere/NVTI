              Hi there.... my name is Philip Anyanful the HOD of the Motor Vechicle Mechanic Certified Automobile Engineer with over 10 years working experience 
              here to show you all the tecnics and skills you need to help you become a better Motor Engineer. I take you throught the course 
              where we tackle it based on about seventy percent(70%) practicals and thirty percent(30%) theory. Come and lets chance you to be a certified Fitter.
             </p>

          <p class="sir_words2"><span>tools we use</span> As mechanical engineerers we have a saying that our tools is our life  and these are the basic tools that are 
        required of you as a mechanical engineerer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Torgue wrench</li>
            <li>Bench Vice</li>
            <li>Hammer</li>
            <li>Mallet</li>
            <li>Set of spanners(open and close end type)</li>
            <li>Tin Shears</li>
            <li>set of pliers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are are a few of the basic tools that would be required by as an electrical engineerer 
            most of these tool would be provided by the school to you
        </p>
        <p><span>we have trained</span> a lot of students whom we have mould into qualified personnel of which some are gracefully employed 
        or they have their own works for which they are masters of. Most of which is because 
    students are taught by highly qualified and skilled instructor who are Degree and higher National Diploma Holders(HND)</p>
        
    <p><span>Attachments</span> students go for attachments at the end of their train in school to further their skills in on-the-job experience which is mandatory for 
    all engineerers in addition to that students are fully involved in when ever we take an external contract 
student get to apply and show their skills fully with real projects of servicing clients 
cars of which sometimes school and staff vechicles are tested and serviced. </p>

<p><span>Taking interest </span> in other course is allowed in NVM provided the student is able to keep up with internal department works 
and the students wises to learn other trades. Other than that student MUST!! stay forcused and impove themself in their field.</p>
